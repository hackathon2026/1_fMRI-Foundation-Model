\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Methods}\label{methods}
% nature guideline
% The Methods section appears in most online original research articles and should contain all elements necessary for interpretation and replication of the results. Methods should be written as concisely as possible and typically do not exceed 3,000 words but may be longer if necessary. Methods-only references do not count against your reference limit. We encourage you to deposit any step-by-step protocols used in your study in the open resource protocols.io. Protocols that are deposited should be mentioned in the Methods section and added to the reference list.

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work. Authors are encouraged to include RIIDs where appropriate. 

\textbf{Ethical approval declarations} (only required where applicable) Any article reporting experiment/s carried out on (i)~live vertebrate (or higher invertebrates), (ii)~humans or (iii)~human samples must include an unambiguous statement within the methods section that meets the following requirements: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Approval: a statement which confirms that all experimental protocols were approved by a named institutional and/or licensing committee. Please identify the approving body in the methods section

\item Accordance: a statement explicitly saying that the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations

\item Informed consent (for experiments involving humans or human tissue samples): include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardian/s
\end{enumerate}

If your manuscript includes potentially identifying patient/participant information, or if it describes human transplantation research, or if it reports results of a clinical trial then  additional information will be required. Please visit (\url{https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies}) for Nature Portfolio journals, (\url{https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/publishing-ethics/14214}) for Springer Nature journals, or (\url{https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies\#ethics+and+consent}) for BMC.


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\bmhead{Supplementary information}

If your article has accompanying supplementary file/s please state so here. 

Authors reporting data from electrophoretic gels and blots should supply the full unprocessed scans for key as part of their Supplementary information. This may be requested by the editorial team/s if it is missing.

Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\bmhead{Acknowledgements}

Acknowledgements are not compulsory. Where included they should be brief. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\section*{Declarations}

Some journals require declarations to be submitted in a standardised format. Please check the Instructions for Authors of the journal to which you are submitting to see if you need to complete this section. If yes, your manuscript must contain the following sections under the heading `Declarations':

\begin{itemize}
\item Funding
\item Conflict of interest/Competing interests (check journal-specific guidelines for which heading to use)
\item Ethics approval and consent to participate
\item Consent for publication
\item Data availability 
\item Materials availability
\item Code availability 
\item Author contribution
\end{itemize}

\section{Section title of first appendix}\label{secA1}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.

%%=============================================%%
%% For submissions to Nature Portfolio Journals %%
%% please use the heading ``Extended Data''.   %%

%% Appendices may be used for helpful, supporting or essential material that would otherwise 
%% clutter, break up or be distracting to the text. Appendices can consist of sections, figures, 
%% tables and equations etc.

\end{appendices}

%%===========================================================================================%%
%% If you are submitting to one of the Nature Portfolio journals, using the eJP submission   %%
%% system, please include the references within the manuscript file itself. You may do this  %%
%% by copying the reference list from your .bbl file, paste it into the main manuscript .tex %%
